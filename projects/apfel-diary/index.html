                "I just turned 18! Kase promised to me that in my 18th birthday we would go on an adventure to the mountains!"<br>
                "(I think he's scared! Hee hee hee)"<br>
                "Anyway, I've been preparing myself for this journey these past days."<br>
                "I practiced a lot with my bo-staff, I'm actually pretty good with it."<br>
                "Still, Kase tells me that there are no dangers in the way to the mountains, so theres no need to fight!"<br>
                "Actually, I just want to show off my skills with the bo-staff Hee hee hee!"<br>
                "About my latest dreams... Hmm... Nothing new, Blume has a pretty boring life.<br>
                "She spends all day in front of her computer reading... Uhh 'Vampire fan-fics'? I think that's what she calls it."<br>
                "I wish I had a computer or something like that, it looks very fun to use"<br>
                "Assuming something like that exists... Of course"<br>

                "Kase woke me up in the middle of the night just to tell me about this crazy dream he just had."<br>
                "He told me that he dreamt that he was the king of a castle made out of cheese, and whenever he was hungry, he would just bite the walls of the castle!"<br>
                "That sounds incredible! I said, while I was groggy laying on my bed."<br>
                "I wish I had these crazy dreams Kase has though... I've only dreamt about one thing ever."<br>
                "Dream after dream... it feels like a connected story."<br>
                "I dream of this girl, her name is Blume. I feel sorry for her, she's always alone, her parents are never at home."<br>
                "I can relate, I've never had parents either. Kase told me that I was born from an apple tree! How is that even possible?"<br>
                "What even are parents? I learnt all of these words and concepts from Blume."<br>
                "How is it possible that I can dream of things and words that I've never seen or heard?"<br>
                "These feel more like memories than dreams..."<br>
                "What is a car? What is a train? What is a computer? What is a dad? What is a mom?"<br>
                "How do I know all of this?"<br>
                "Why have I never seen someone like the people I've seen in my dreams?"<br>
                ":("<br>
                "That's why I love sleeping, I spend all the time dreaming about her, then, when I wake up, I sit at my desk and I start writing everything down in these books."<br>
                "After all... there's not a lot I can do here, Blume's world is so fun... Mine on the other hand... is so boring, there are no shops, no playgrounds, no movies... no friends..."<br>
                "I can't believe I haven't lost my mind after 18 years of this, I'm pretty sure Blume would have!"<br>
                "Anyway, I think that's it for today."<br>
