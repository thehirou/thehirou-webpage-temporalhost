        <p class="indent">I should actually consume, uh, "vampire media" if I want my character to actually be obsessed with it because writing this was weird as fuck. I don't even know what was happening to me here, I just sat on my computer and started writing, possesed by some kind of entity that forced me to write this monstruosity of a text.
        <p class="indent">Also I wanted to set the font to comic sans but I think it's for the best to leave it as serif...
