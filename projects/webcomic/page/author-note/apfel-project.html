<p class="no-indent a-p-title">The entire Apfel Project script:
<hr>
<p class="no-indent a-p-title">ACT 1
<hr>
<p class="indent">Everything starts flashing, you start to see events where you are taking place, these images start appearing faster and faster, until you wake up.
<p class="indent">You're Blume Weizen, It's the middle of the night and you decide to go to the kitchen to get a midnight snack, you're hella hungry for some reason.
    <div class="a-p-dialog-box">
        <p class="blume no-indent">BLUME: There's no milk left... :(
    </div> 
<p class="indent">Blume looks around, maybe there are signs of her parents having arrived home already. But no.
    <div class="a-p-dialog-box">
        <p class="blume no-indent">BLUME: Mom and Dad still haven't arrived home...
    </div>
<p class="indent">Blume takes a walk around the kitchen, hoping to find some silly snack to eat, but there's no luck, the only thing left is leftover spaghetti but, you're not in the mood for leftover spaghetti.
<p class="indent">You go upstairs, then you take a look at the clock, you guess it's pretty late already...
    <div class="a-p-dialog-box">
        <p class="blume no-indent">BLUME: It's three in the morning...
        <p class="blume no-indent">BLUME: I hate having these nightmares, I haven't been able to sleep decently for months :(
    </div>
<p class="indent">You go back to your room, it's messy as always, there are records all over the floor, your computer is not correctly shut down and your silly little pet, Munchie, is sleeping, "snug as a bug in a rug" you'd say.
<p class="indent">You decide to go back to sleep, there's no point on wandering around the house at these hours of the night, also, you have school tomorrow so you have to wake up early.
<p class="indent">You lay on the bed, close your eyes, and you actually wake up, and I mean actually because it seems like all of that was a dream, dreamt by Apfel Mus.
<hr>
<p class="indent">Now you're Apfel Mus, a girl that lives next to a forest, your mentor, and also best friend, Kase, is a mouse, he has been taking care of you since you were born. He usually tells you that it was him who found you in the forest as a baby, you were under an apple tree, that's why Kase always tells you that you were born from an apple tree.
<p class="indent">You have a lot of paintings hanged in your bedroom, one of them is a picture of the mountains you saw in a book. The picture was too small so you decided to repaint it into the canvas.
<p class="indent">Since you had memory, you always wondered what might be on the other side of the mountains that surround your home. You always tell Kase that you want to go there with him someday but all he tells you is that you should wait until you grow older.
<p class="indent">You wonder how Kase is doing, he must be awake by now so you blast into the living room.
    <div class="a-p-dialog-box">
        <p class="apfel no-indent">APFEL: Good morning Kase! Rise and shine!
        <p class="apfel no-indent">APFEL: Guess what!
        <p class="kase no-indent">KASE: G'rugh... What...
        <p class="apfel no-indent">APFEL: I had a dream and there was that girl again!
        <p class="apfel no-indent">APFEL: I've been dreaming about her for months now...
        <p class="apfel no-indent">APFEL: It feels so weird.
        <p class="kase no-indent">KASE: It sure is weird.
    </div>
<p class="no-indent">"Apfel grumbles at Kase"
    <div class="a-p-dialog-box">
        <p class="kase no-indent">KASE: Well, I had a dream about this huuuge castle! It was made out of cheese.
        <p class="kase no-indent">KASE: Whenever I was hungry I just had to take a bite out of the walls!
        <p class="kase no-indent">KASE: Eek eek eek eek!
        <p class="kase no-indent">KASE: But then SOMEONE, woke me up.
        <p class="apfel no-indent">APFEL: Ugh, I'm sorry!!
    </div>
<p class="indent">Kase gets out of his hammock, stretches a little bit and stares at Apfel, she looks like she wants something.
    <div class="a-p-dialog-box">
        <p class="apfel no-indent">APFEL: By the way Kase...
        <p class="apfel no-indent">APFEL: When are we going to go to the mountains?
        <p class="kase no-indent">KASE: ...
        <p class="apfel no-indent">APFEL: You told me that we were going to go on my 18th birthday...
        <p class="apfel no-indent">APFEL: Did you forget about it or something like that?
        <p class="kase no-indent">KASE: Oh... yes, the mountains, i didn't forget about that...
        <p class="apfel no-indent">APFEL: Are you scared by any chance?
        <p class="apfel no-indent">APFEL: I would understand, but it would be kind of dissapointing...
        <p class="kase no-indent">KASE: Me?! Scared?!
        <p class="kase no-indent">KASE: Of course not!
        <p class="apfel no-indent">APFEL: Then what are we waiting for?!
        <p class="apfel no-indent">APFEL: My birthday was MONTHS ago!
    </div>
<p class="indent">Kase starts walking in circles, thinking, nervous, he has to take a decision right now, he had been delaying this the most he was able to because he was scared that Apfel could get hurt. But he knows that he wasn't able to be delaying the journey forever, he had to mentalize about the situation and he didn't.
    <div class="a-p-dialog-box">
        <p class="kase no-indent">KASE: I guess you're right...
        <p class="kase no-indent">KASE: But I can't let you go defenseless!
        <p class="kase no-indent">KASE: What if you get hurt?
        <p class="kase no-indent">KASE: Even if I go with you, there's not a lot I can do to protect you.
        <p class="apfel no-indent">APFEL: You're being too overprotective, there can't be any dangers there, Kase.
        <p class="kase no-indent">KASE: Okay... I guess this was inevitable after all.
        <p class="kase no-indent">KASE: We will start our trip right now, don't forget your bo-staff.
    </div>
<p class="no-indent">"Apfel shows an excitement she had never showed before."
<p class="indent">Apfel gets ready, takes her bo-staff, some spare clothes and something to eat, Kase is already waiting outside, doesn't seem like him, he would do anything to not let you go to the mountains, after all he always does that because he's worried of you, but you're a grown woman now! You can handle danger by yourself, and your bo-staff.
<p class="no-indent">"Apfel fidgets with the bo-staff."
<p class="indent">You hope he's not speeding through the journey so he can find something about the forest that might scare you away, Kase doesn't know that that wont work on you!
    <div class="a-p-dialog-box">
        <p class="kase no-indent">KASE: C'mon Apfel!
        <p class="kase no-indent">KASE: I'm guessing that you don't want it to get dark before we get to the mountains.
    </div>
<p class="indent">Kase knows that one of the few things you're scared of is the dark, how rude of him but that will only make you go through this journey as soon as possible.
    <div class="a-p-dialog-box">
        <p class="apfel no-indent">APFEL: Yeez, he's taking this trip very seriously...
    </div>
<p class="indent">You follow Kase, he knows the way to the forest, it seems that we have to go through there to get to the mountains.
