        <p class="indent">Wow! Change of artstyle!? I would have never guessed that!!!!! But yea, I actually kind of liked the bad-drawings-drawn-in-the-middle-of-a-boring-class artstyle but I had to put my personal prerendered backgrounds touch (This will probably end up being a pain in the ass to model and I'll stick to drawings on 90% of the pages) 
        <p class="indent">Also, don't mind this page, I know it's a shitty render, I made it in like five minutes, couldn't bother tbh, I have the Apfel Project on high priority right now
