                        <p class="blume center merriweather">Chapter 1: Twilight at the café
                        <hr> 
                        <p class="blume merriweather book-indent">
                            I found myself seeking refuge in my favorite local café to escape the relentless rain outside. 
                            There, I relished the soothing melody of the raindrops, accompanied by the warmth of my steaming cup of coffee.
                            —"Weird," I said, —"usually you throw us all out of here when it's closing time with such a hurry, what's the matter today?" I asked.
                            <br><br>
                            <p class="blume merriweather book-indent">
                                —"Well, first of all, I don't want your beautiful bangs to get wet with all this heavy rain" Morgana Shadowfang said to me in a flirtatious way.
                                —"Yes, my bangs, I love my bangs, I wouldn't want the rain to ruin them," I responded. 
                            <br><br>
                        <p class="blume merriweather book-indent">
                            —"One thing is certain, and that is that you have to leave before the sun sets," said Morgana very seriously, —"I can lend you my umbrella if you want." added Morgana.
                            <br><br>
                            <p class="blume merriweather book-indent">  
                                —"Why is that? are you by any chance... A VAMPIRE?!" I jokingly asked, raising my voice more than I should have. —"Haha, of course not, I'm not a vampire. I don't believe in such things"
                            said Morgana with a nervous tone in his voice. —"Then you don't mind if I stay a little longer?" I asked.
                            <br><br>
                            <p class="blume merriweather book-indent"> 
                            Morgana then made a small pause, and sighed —"You see... I told you to go before the sun sets because I don't want you to go home by yourself in the dark, no other reason..."
                            Morgana reaffirmed.
                            <br><br>
                            <p class="blume merriweather book-indent">  
                                —"Why don't you walk me home then?" I asked Morgana. —"I haven't even finished my cup of coffee yet!" Morgana didn't know how to respond.
                            <br><br>
                            <p class="blume merriweather book-indent">  
                            Seven o'clock... the sun started to set since it's winter already, Morgana leaned in to see the exterior through the showcase, he then proceeded to drop something on the floor and acted as if he was picking it up. —"This is why I should have picked the morning shift..." Morgana murmured.
                            —"Is everything okay?" I asked Morgana while trying to look over the counter to see if he was fine. That's when I realized...
                            <br><br>
                            <p class="blume merriweather book-indent"> 
                                —"Oh my fucking god, Morgana, you have fangs! You're a fucking vampire!" I exclaimed, Morgana shushed at me. —"SHHH!" —"That's so cool!" I whispered. —"You have fangs, and I have bangs, togheter we could be FANGS & BANGS™!" I told Morgana.
                                <br><br>
                                <p class="blume merriweather book-indent"> 
                                —"Do you really think it's cool?" Morgana asked —"I kept it a secret for so long because I was scared..." Morgana confessed. —"Morgana, I literally can't think of anything more cool than being a fucking vampire, we should definetely make out in the next chapter." I told Morgana
                                —"What? Chapter? What are you talking about, Blume?" he asked, with a tone of confusion.
                                <BR><BR>
                                <p class="text-black center">I think that's enough vampire literature for today...
