Emilio is now depressed, duh, he isolates himself in his house, regretting what happened every single day of his life, he starts setting aside that skepticism he had for alchemy and starts taking it seriously, he created his own faith out of fear...
<br><br>
...Fear of thinking that the body of his wife, that was once moving, walking, talking, feeling, thinking, seeing... is now just decomposed matter... he wanted to believe so badly that there had to be something more after death, so he could see his wife again in his next life.
