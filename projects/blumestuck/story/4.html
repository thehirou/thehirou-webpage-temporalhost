Your name is BLUME WEIZEN. As was previously mentioned,	 today is your BIRTHDAY. And even though you don't have friends in real life to celebrate it you can still do it with your INTERNET FRIENDS.
You have a variety of INTERESTS. You love reading VAMPIRE LITERATURE. You like to BUILD WEBSITES and then post them on neocities. But what you love most is cooking SPAGHETTI (You enjoy even more eating it, though.)
