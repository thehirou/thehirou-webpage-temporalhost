║     It's surprisingly hard to find alchemy iconography in the internet archive, or at least get information about some
║     specific obscure alchemy symbols. Some resources even contradict each other, for example, some books say that the Octagram
║     is associated to Venus, other books say that instead it is to Mercury... etc...
║
║     Either way I think that with the research I already made about alchemy, it shows that I'm not putting random things and symbols
║     into the game and that I got a decent knowledge of the meaning of the things I use... and that's another thing, I can just give
║     anything I want my own meaning, I'm not supposed to be restricted by the "rules" of alchemy, in the first place because nothing
║     is coherent in the books I've been reading lol.

║     I really want to start another project when I finish Apfel Project, maybe a webcomic, a different type of game, or maybe an ARG,
║     I always wanted to make an ARG, in fact, I tried multiple times but ended up getting ignored or unfinished :P
║
║     Now, when I make my next project I want it to have excellently written characters, there's no point on having the best lore in the world
║     if the characters are poorly written, and even though I tried my best to write the characters in Apfel Project I think I'm still way way far
║     from perfection.
║
║     Sometimes I think of the message the Apfel Project is supposed to send to the player, but let me tell you that I don't even know, if it ends
║     up giving an important message it will probably have something to do with my subsconscious while writing the story.
║     I shouldn't really care if people don't like my game, even if the game is way too ambitious, this is something I just want to finish, I'll always
║     have the excuse that Apfel Project was my first ever project if there are people saying that they don't like the music/story/characters/graphics etc...

║     too bad these don't have the power a Switch has.

║     Hello Apfel Project enjoyers, I'm currently working on the ACT 1 of the Apfel Project and I made this weird blog thingy
║     on my website so I thought I might take advantage of that and update this like some kind of journal. A more personal one because
║     who in the world is going to find this? LOL
║
║     As some might know, the Apfel Project ACT 1 might not be delivered at the date I previously announced (December 20th), this is due to the
║     overwhelming ammount of backgrounds I have to make and my lack of experience using Blender. Kinda crazy to think about all the
║     skills I had to develop to make this project... programming, making music, writing, drawing, animating (kinda), and now 3D!
║
║     Other reason for the delay is that I'm starting college in a couple weeks and I didn't take into account for the time it would consume
║     me between September and December. So yeah, I'm going to keep it slow, I now have 1000 people interested in this project so I don't
║     have to worry about it!
║
║     And the secret reason of the delay is that I've been playing Persona 5 Royal non stop for weeks! LOL
║     Now I'm trying to romance Futaba, she's literally my type, but anyways, I might be getting carried away too much.
║     P.S. Leveling Kindness stats was hard LOL.
║
║     I've listening to My Chemical Romance lately (Yes, in 2023) and man, I didn't think they would be that good, I really like their music,
║     they tend to use these nostalgic-like chord progressions that I myself use a lot on my songs so, I like that hehe :3
